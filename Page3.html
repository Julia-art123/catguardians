    <div class="intro">
    <p>Stray cats can cause significant harm to both ecosystems and human communities. Each year, a single stray cat can kill 100 to 200 small animals, even contributing to species extinction. Beyond ecological damage, stray cats face severe hardships—hunger, disease, and exposure to the elements—while also potentially spreading diseases like rabies.</p>
    <p class="spacing">Though many kind-hearted people feed stray cats, this often worsens the issue by encouraging population growth. The most effective solutions are TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) and adoption. These approaches not only reduce stray cat numbers but also ensure healthier lives for the cats.</p>

            <h2>Introduction to TNR</h2>
            <p>TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) is a humane and effective way to control stray cat populations. The process involves humanely trapping cats, spaying or neutering them, and administering vaccinations before returning them to their original habitat. By breaking the cycle of reproduction, TNR helps stabilize the population, preventing overcrowding and strain on resources. In addition, neutered cats tend to display fewer nuisance behaviors, such as mating calls and territorial fights.</p>
            <p>TNR benefits communities by reducing the number of stray cats entering shelters, lowering euthanasia rates, and cutting down shelter costs. It is recognized by many animal welfare organizations as the most effective and sustainable way to manage outdoor cat colonies, compared to traditional "catch and kill" methods.</p>

            <h2>The Power of Adoption</h2>
            <p>Adopting stray cats is crucial for both the cats themselves and the broader community. Stray cats often face harsh conditions—hunger, disease, and injuries from accidents or fights. By adopting, you provide them with a safe and loving home, significantly improving their quality of life. At the same time, adoption helps reduce the number of cats in shelters or those euthanized due to overpopulation.</p>
